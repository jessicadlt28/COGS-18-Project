    "Hello! \n",
    "For my project, I wanted to create a chatbot that assists with the issue that is **INDECISIVENESS**, specifically when choosing a film to watch! I felt that a chatbot would be a great format to approach this because it imitates what it may be like to discuss movie options with another person, except now we have a chatbot that is attempting to help. My chatbot is called **\"Filmsical\"**, and she first collects the movie category you would like, then she asks what specific genre from that category, and from there she asks fun questions that apply to some movie options as a way to recommend a movie you may like! Currently, the movie recommendations _are limited_, but they are some great movies I feel represent the diverse categories.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I would like to emphasize that I genuinely tried my best and I hope it shows. This is my first time working with python (any coding actually), and this topic project was one that I had fun doing, but definitely struggled with. You will notice that when it comes to the test file, I was unable to get it to run properly. No matter hat I tried, I was unable to properly import the functions. Regardless, I tried to show Filmsical's greatness, and hopefully it is able to help you choose an enjoyable movie! "
